## Bio ##

  I'm working as a Business Development Manager at the APEDA.
  
  I, recently, worked as a 'Consultant - Dairy Market' for the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/about/en/) under the project "Guidelines to increase the resilience of agricultural supply chains: Getting on the right track to stabilize production and markets".

   I received a Ph.D degree from the [ICAR - National Dairy Research Institute](http://ndri.res.in/), Karnal, HR, India. The title of my Ph.D. thesis was [Impact evaluation of anionic mineral mixture supplementation on milk production and the milk fever: A randomized controlled trial](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/5108).
